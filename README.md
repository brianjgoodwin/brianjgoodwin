## Hi, I'm Brian.

I’m doing a lot of stuff with computers right now.

### Projects & Interests
- **Apple platform apps** – Two apps published on the App Stores, including a journaling app for iOS and a minimalist, Markdown text editor for macOS. Mostly SwiftUI.
- **Data analysis & visualization** – At work, I build dashboards, analyze sales patterns, and segment customers.
- **Web experiments** – I tinker with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make fun stuff.
