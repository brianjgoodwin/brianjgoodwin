- Hi, I’m @brianjgoodwin aka Brian!
- I’m interested in Python, AI, and game development, all at a hobbyist level. And also reading, fitness, and photography.
- I’m always tinkering with Python and learning new things. I'm currently learning Unity's IDE and (re)learning Blender.
- You can reach me at gmail (brianjgoodwin) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-j-goodwin/)
